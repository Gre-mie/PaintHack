Next thing to work on:

- exicutibles upload (downloads, admin)
- setup and test itch.io page
- run in browser upload (downloads, admin)
NOTE: may want multiple config files, one for each OS so I can copy it into conf.lua instead of constently changing combing through the file to alter things back an forth

- split areas of screen
	- top nav bar (newpage)
	- side bar (pen)
	- colour bar (retractable?)


- buttons with mouse detection
	- images
	- interface
	- change mouse cursor when button is clicked 
		cursor images:
			- crosshairs	 (cross)
			- pointer	 (arrow)
			Extra: paintbrush, pointy hand?
